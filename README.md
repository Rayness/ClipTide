> [!NOTE]
> This small program is designed to download video content in audio and video formats from YouTube video hosting. It all runs in Python using the [ydl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) library for downloading videos, and [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for the console interface. In addition, [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) is also used, it has already been downloaded and placed in the program folder.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> ### Please note!
> The application requires **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** installed. If it is not, an automatic installation will be performed. By downloading the applications you agree to the installation of **Python** on your personal computer. If you already have a version of **Python** lower than _3.13_ installed, you need to install this version, or higher. Or delete the installed Python and the program will download the latest version
