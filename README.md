## General information
> [!NOTE]
> This small program is designed to download video content in audio and video formats from the YouTube video hosting, but other platforms are also supported, such as: Rutube, Vkvideo, ok and many others. Everything works in Python using the [ydl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) library for loading videos, as well as [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for designing the console and [pywebview](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview) for the graphical interface. [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) is used to work with codecs, it has already been downloaded and placed in the program folder.
